• UI made with Bootstrap<br/>
• Data stored in H2 in-memory database<br/>
• Angular package manager - npm<br/>
• Mobile-friendly<br/>
• Regarding i18n - seems that it was achieved without any special steps/preparations<br/>
&nbsp; (As I understand it needed unicode support e.g. cyrillic, asian, arabian characters)<br/>
• Doesn't have tests due to lack of practice<br/><br/>
